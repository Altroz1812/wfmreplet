A design for a workflow management system to replicate the provided flowchart would include a workflow engine capable of handling stages, parallel paths, and role-based access control (RBAC). The core components would be as follows:

Workflow Creation Module: This module lets users define and customize workflows. It's the central hub for mapping out the entire process.

Stage and Sub-stage Management: Users can create distinct stages (like "Loan application stage") and sub-stages, each with its own screens and layouts.

UI/UX with Advanced Layouts: The user interface (UI) should support dynamic screen layouts that can be configured for each stage, allowing for fields to be assigned, and master data for dropdowns to be added.

Data and Field Mapping: The system needs a way to link specific data fields to particular screens and stages. This allows for the collection and validation of information at the right points in the process.

User and RBAC Mapping: A user management module is essential for creating user masters and mapping them to specific roles. This is critical for controlling who can access, approve, or modify a workflow at different stages.

Parallel Workflow Capability: The system must be able to handle parallel paths, such as the simultaneous "Legal sanction" and "Technical sanction" processes shown in the flowchart.

API Integration: The workflow engine needs to be a standalone, API-first module. This is crucial as it allows for a decoupled architecture, enabling it to be integrated with a future backend system. This approach also ensures that the workflow engine can be a "plug-and-play" component.

Key Features and Workflow Implementation
The design should reflect the specific requirements of the provided flowchart, which outlines a loan application process.


Prequalification Stage: This is the initial stage where data is collected and applicants are verified. The workflow should support this data collection and validation.


Loan Application Stage: The main part of the process where applicants complete forms and provide documents. The system needs to support parallel tasks, as seen with the "Legal sanction," "Technical sanction," and "Credit appraisal" paths.



Document Management: The workflow should have built-in support for collecting, tagging, and storing documents.

Approval and Decisioning: The system must be able to route the application for approval or rejection based on defined rules. This includes handling positive and negative decisions. The workflow should also manage re-submissions or changes requested by the approver.




Integration with External Systems: The workflow needs to be capable of integrating with other systems like the Los and CRM, as shown in the flow.

Monitoring and Reporting: A dashboard would be necessary to monitor the status of each application and provide insights into the overall process efficiency.
